// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magician_names = ['Rafay', 'Sameer', 'Asghar', 'kinza', 'Noman'];
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magician_names.length; i++) {
        magician_names.splice(i, 1, "".concat(magician_names[i], " The Great"));
    }
}
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    for (var _i = 0, magicians_1 = magicians; _i < magicians_1.length; _i++) {
        var magician = magicians_1[_i];
        console.log(magician);
    }
}
make_great(magician_names);
