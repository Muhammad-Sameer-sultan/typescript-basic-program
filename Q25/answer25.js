// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
var alien_color = 'Green';
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
console.log('In this version the condition will be True and print message');
if (alien_color === 'Green') {
    console.log('Congragulations! you just Earned 5 points');
}
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
console.log('In this version the condition will not be True and not output show');
if (alien_color === 'Yellow') {
    console.log('Congragulations! you just Earned 5 points');
}
