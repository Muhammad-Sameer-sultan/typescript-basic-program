// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.

// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
 let favorite_fruits: string[]=['mango', 'apple', 'banana'];
 for (let i = 0; i < favorite_fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(`My favorite Fruit is: ${favorite_fruits[i]}`)
    
 }
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
