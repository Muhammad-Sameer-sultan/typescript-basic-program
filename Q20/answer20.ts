// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries:string[]=['Tokyo', 'Moroco', 'Singapore', 'Istambol', 'Sidne']
for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
    console.log(countries[i]);
